    "Welcome to the course assessment for the Advanced Data Science unit. In this assessment you will build a prediction system for UK house prices. \n",

    "Your prediction system will be based on data from the UK Price Paid data available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads). By combining this data with the UK Office for National Statistics data on the latitude/longitude of postcodes (available [here](https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo)) you will have a record of house prices and their approximate latitude/longitude. Due to the size of these data you will use a relational database to handle them.  \n",

    "To make predictions of the house price you will augment your data with information obtained from Open Street Map: an open license source of mapping information. You will use the techniques you have learnt in the course to indentify and incorporate useful features for house price prediction.\n",

    "Alongside your implementation you will provide a short repository overview describing how you have implemented the different parts of the project and where you have placed those parts in your code repository. You will submit your code alongside a version of this notebook that will allow your examiner to understand and reconstruct the thinking behind your analysis. This notebook is structured to help you in creating that description and allow you to understand how we will allocate the marks. You should make use of the Fynesse framework (<https://github.com/lawrennd/fynesse_template>) for structuring your code. \n",

If it's very often, it would likely be better to store the entired database joined, because the one-off cost for that join is amortised across all the future predictions. If only a few predictions are required (like in our lab class) then doing that join on the fly might be better. In that case you can make use of an  *inner join* for this data set creation.\n",

We expect that knowledge of the local region around the property should be helpful in making those price predictions. To evaluate this we will now look at [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) as a data source.\n",

    "Accessing OpenStreetMap through its API can be done using the python library `osmx`. Using what you have learned about the `osmx` interface in the lectures, write general code for downloading points of interest and other relevant information that you believe may be useful for predicting house prices. Remembering the perspectives we've taken on *data science as debugging*, the remarks we've made when discussing *the data crisis* of the importance of reusability in data analysis, and the techniques we've explored in the labsessions for visualising features and exploring their correlation use the notebook to document your assessment of the OpenStreetMap data as a potential source of data.\n",
