    "Welcome to the course assessment for the Advanced Data Science unit. In this assessment you will build a prediction system for UK house prices. \n",

    "Your prediction system will be based on data from the UK Price Paid data available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads). By combining this data with the UK Office for National Statistics data on the latitude/longitude of postcodes (available [here](https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo)) you will have a record of house prices and their approximate latitude/longitude. Due to the size of these data you will use a relational database to handle them.  \n",

    "To make predictions of the house price you will augment your data with information obtained from Open Street Map: an open license source of mapping information. You will use the techniques you have learnt in the course to indentify and incorporate useful features for house price prediction.\n",

    "Alongside your implementation you will provide a short repository overview describing how you have implemented the different parts of the project and where you have placed those parts in your code repository. You will submit your code alongside a version of this notebook that will allow your examiner to understand and reconstruct the thinking behind your analysis. This notebook is structured to help you in creating that description and allow you to understand how we will allocate the marks. You should make use of the Fynesse framework (<https://github.com/lawrennd/fynesse_template>) for structuring your code. \n",

    "In question 3 you will be given the task of constructing a prediction system for property price levels at a given location. We expect that knowledge of the local region around the property should be helpful in making those price predictions. To evaluate this we will now look at [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) as a data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks below will guide you in accessing and assessing the OpenStreetMap data. The code you write will eventually be assimilated in your python module, but documentation of what you've included and why should remain in the notebook below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing OpenStreetMap through its API can be done using the python library `osmx`. Using what you have learned about the `osmx` interface in the lectures, write general code for downloading points of interest and other relevant information that you believe may be useful for predicting house prices. Remembering the perspectives we've taken on *data science as debugging*, the remarks we've made when discussing *the data crisis* of the importance of reusability in data analysis, and the techniques we've explored in the labsessions for visualising features and exploring their correlation use the notebook to document your assessment of the OpenStreetMap data as a potential source of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge you need to do a first pass through this question will have been taught by end of lab session three (16th November 2021). You will likely want to review your answer as part of *refactoring* your code and analysis pipeline shortly before hand in.\n",

    "For your final tick, we will be asking you to make house price predictions for a given location, date and property type in the UK. You will provide a function that takes input a latitude and longitude as well as the `property_type` (either type\" of property (either `F` - flat, `S` - semidetached, `D` - detached, `T` - terraced or `O` other). Create this function in the `address.py` file, for example in the form,\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Select a bounding box around the housing location in latitude and longitude.\n",
    "2. Select a data range around the prediction date. \n",
    "3. Use the data ecosystem you have build above to build a training set from the relevant time period and location in the UK. Include appropriate features from OSM to improve the prediction.\n",
    "4. Train a linear model on the data set you have created.\n",
    "5. Validate the quality of the model.\n",
    "6. Provide a prediction of the price from the model, warning appropriately if your validation indicates the quality of the model is poor.\n",
